Creating a complete real-world backend for a bootcamp directory app is beyond the scope of a single response, but I can provide you with a general outline of how you could approach building it using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Please note that this is a simplified example, and a production-ready application may require additional features, security measures, and error handling.

Setting up the project:

Create a new Node.js project using npm init.
Install required dependencies like Express, MongoDB driver, etc.
Database Setup:

Set up a MongoDB database (either locally or using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas).
Create a collection to store bootcamp data.
Create the Server:

Set up the Express application to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Implement middleware for parsing incoming requests (e.g., body-parser).
Define Routes:

Create routes for various CRUD operations related to bootcamps (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
Each route should correspond to a specific endpoint (e.g., /api/bootcamps, /api/bootcamps/:id).
Implement Controllers:

Create controller functions to handle the logic for each route.
These functions should interact with the database as needed (using the MongoDB driver or an ORM like Mongoose).
Validation and Sanitization:

Implement validation and sanitization of incoming data to ensure it meets the required criteria.
Use libraries like Joi or Validator to simplify this process.
Authentication and Authorization (Optional):

If needed, implement user authentication and authorization to protect certain routes or actions.
Error Handling:

Set up error handling middleware to catch and handle errors in a consistent manner.
Security Measures (Optional):

Implement security measures such as sanitizing inputs, preventing SQL injection, and using helmet.js for HTTP headers.
Deployment:

Deploy your backend to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
Ensure your database is properly configured and accessible.
